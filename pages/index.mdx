# Cliff Mirschel

Hi, I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 5 years of profesional experience building and managing advanced web applications and multi-tiered systems. 

I enjoy working with many different technologies and progamming languages such as Python, Typescript, Java, Node.js, HTML, and CSS.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
