# Cliff Mirschel

Hi, my name is Cliff. I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 5 years of professional experience in building, managing, and depolying web/mobile applications at scale.  

I enjoy analyzing and solving complex engineering problems through fast, simple code. 
Some of my favorite programming languages include Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
