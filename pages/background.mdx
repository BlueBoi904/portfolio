# Background

I began my software engineering journey working for a start-up company in the transportation/bus ticketing industy called [Transcor Data Services (TDS)](https://tdstickets.com). 

In this role, I gained a vast amount of experience in several key areas of software engineering. I was responsible for developing and maintaining highly-trafficed web and mobile applicaions used by companies all around the world such as Greyhound Lines. 

I even had the chance to develop software for embedded systems including pyhsical ticketing kiosks and ticket scaning machines. 

This role was a great opportunity for me to learn and grow as a software engineer. My time at TDS was a great experience and I am very grateful for the opportunity to work there.


By the end of 2019, I decided to leave TDS and pursue a new opportunity for a mid-level software engineering role at a company called [Total Wine & More](https://www.totalwine.com).

During my time in this role, I was responsible for the development and deployment of several core web and mobile applications. These applicaions were used by thousands of customers online and employees in-store around the country.

I excelled in this role, and was quickly promoted to a Senior Software Engineering role with Total Wine & More. 

As a Senior Engineer, I was responsible for leading a team of software engineers and managing the development of several key applications. In particular, I specialized in weekly deployment releases and the development of new features for our mobile applications.
